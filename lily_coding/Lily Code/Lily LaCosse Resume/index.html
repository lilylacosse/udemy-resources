        <h3>About</h3>
        <p id="about"> Energetic and curious, I find myself tracing the electrical fractal down to its smallest
            element.
            I love to
            learn about process.
            I am fascinated by how computers allow us to make information more and more useful via software.
            My own frustration with how information is organized
            and its accessibility has greatly piqued my interest in learning to code. I know how much thoughtful,
            well-written code aides in my own day to day work.
            I want to learn how to develop systems that manage data succinctly with great utility to the user. </p>
